# Some Passwords Should Be Exceptional

When you're using a password manager,
they usually come with a tool to generate passwords as well.
Mostly, they either generate a series random characters,
or a longer series of random real words.
Both are secure enough to be effectively uncrackable,
given the right parameters.

For my own passwords,
I mostly have been using a wordlist to generate passwords.
They're plenty long- ending up being over 60, sometimes 80 or more characters,
and beyond 128 [bits of entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Required_bits_of_entropy)-
Perfectly acceptable.
Slap 2FA on top of that, and you're golden.

***But despite it all, the password still needs to include a number...***

It's a case that happens all the time. \
I had experienced this setting up a *GoFundMe* account
to [*raise funds*](https://gofundme.com/f/rosie-rush) for my cat.

To solve the *'security problem'* GoFundMe raised,
I simply appended a `1` at the end of my already-long password.

They're passwords that are by all means secure, uncrackable, and unguessable-
but it was deemed no good, because there *wasn't a number*.

It makes me think that just as there are heuristics for password *minimums*,
there ought to be heuristics for password **maximums**--
Exceptions to the baseline password rules
once some certain thresholds are exceeded.

* Over 60, 75 characters? *Allow an exception.*
* Over 128, 256 bits of entropy? *Allow an exception.*

If this idea is a footgun,
I can't think of how so per se.
_Let me know what you think!_

Hi, if you've read this far, my cat, Rosie, is in need of help,
and I am financially at the ends of my means doing so. \
**Please donate to help her!**
The story of Rosie is both [on her fundraiser page](/pet/rosie/fundraiser)
as well as on the GoFundMe page itself. \
All donors who publicly share their names are
enshrined on [Rosie's webpage](/pet/rosie), too.
