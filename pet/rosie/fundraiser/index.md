# Rosie Rush!!!

This is **Rosie**, full name *Rosalind Franklin*, my sweet dear 10-year-old cat.
She's been in my care for the past three years, and has been a beloved part of my life as well as the lives of many others.
In addition to Rosie being a winning cat overall, she has also won ***Cat of the Month*** (on my own website) **4** times in 2024 so far.

**But Rosie is not well right now.** She is strong, but right now she needs help, and **I am at the ends of my financial means to do so** out-of-pocket.

## The Story

About two weeks ago, her right eye began showing symptoms of irritation-
including tears and her 'second eyelid' being half-shut.
After seeing this was worse than a passing irritation, I took her to the kind vets of the *Smith Animal Hospital*.

![Rosie's Eye Exam](https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/84352667_1732346259186794_r.jpeg)

Her first vet visit diagnosed a **corneal scratch** and prescribed her *Tobramycin* drops and *NeoPolyBac* ointment.
She had been on these two medications, twice per-day, every day.

One week later, upon a follow-up reexamination, her diagnosis worsened.
Her eye had been swelling, and her diagnosis was changed to **buphtalmos**, or an enlarged eye globe.
She was referred to the *College of Veterinary Medicine* at Mississippi State University at 9AM the next morning.

The wonderful people of the *Animal Health Center* on-campus took great care of Rosie, but had to deliver a worse diagnosis.
***Exophthalmos***; Her right eye had *not been swollen*, but *pushed out by a growth* behind it.
In turn, her eye had been re-diagnosed to have a *superficial **corneal ulcer***.
*Tobramycin* is now replaced with OTC lubricating drops for her comfort.

Their greatest suspicion of the mass' cause is a **tumor**,
but other possibilities cited include *infections*, *inflammation*, *cysts* or *'foreign bodies'*.
Her corneal ulcer is likely due to increased exposure of the area due to the bulging of her eye. She cannot fully close it.

**At this point in time, we do not know what. And knowing is expensive, *and treating it will be further.***

*I have spent nearly **$500** out-of-pocket on care for Rosie on this emergency so far.*
**I am at the limits of what it is possible for me to expend** further as a college student with just a part-time job.
But **Rosie deserves the best healthcare**. She has given me so much love and helped me when I felt need for her.

*I cannot abandon her when she needs me, and I hope you can help me help her.*

## Further Options
### 1. CT Scan and Ultrasound + Needle Aspirate
The best possible diagnosis for Rosie would be to get a CT scan of her head,
and then have an aspirate performed on her eye using a small needle and ultrasound.
This would allow them to differentiate whether the source of the problem is inflammation, or a tumor.
If it is a tumor, it could tell what type of tumor it is.
The cost of this would be **between $1400 to upwards of $1700**.

### 2. Just a CT Scan
The lower option would be to perform a CT scan of Rosie without sampling.
This would at *least* show where the mass is located and *likely* will differentiate between inflammation and a tumor.
The cost of this would be **between $1200 to upwards of $1500**.

### 3. Just Tissue Sampling
The lowest possible option, the only one I could possibly independently afford yet worse possible quality-
Just an ultrasound with tissue needle sampling.
It is, to quote from her discharge, *"less likely to result in a diagnosis and will not show all of the tissues potentially involved"*.
The cost of this would yet still be **$500-$600**.

If I get nothing from this campaign to help Rosie,
this last option is all I could afford, and even then I would be broke for further treatment in the worst-case.
*It feels like the end of the line. I have no further options than to appeal for help.*

For whatever diagnosis she receives, the worst-case is dire.
**An eye removal is listed as a possible outcome.** *Rosie does not deserve this.*

## Please, Help Rosie.

This is an unknown future, and I am worried. Rosie needs help. We both need help.
If you can donate to help Rosie's healthcare, I would greatly appreciate it.
[Rosie has her own webpage](https://wolfgang.space/pet/rosie), and if you donate any amount for her, I will feature your name there as a sign of my appreciation.
If you cannot afford to donate, you can still help by sharing this so that someone who has the means to donate may see it.
