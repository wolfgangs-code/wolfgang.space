# Rosie Rushers
In late November 2024, Rosie's right eye had developed a malignant tumor behind it. \
This emergency required swift diagnosis and treatment,
which I could not afford on my own.

To support Rosie, these wonderful people
[donated](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rosie-rush)
to her healthcare,
for which they will forever be appreciated:
