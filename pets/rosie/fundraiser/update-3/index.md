# Rosie Rush
## Update 3: Acceptance, CT Imaging and Steroids
*It's Thursday, December 19th, 2024.*

I apologize for the lack of updates last week;\
It was finals week and I was balancing that with work,
which left me with little energy for anything else.

## Tissue Sampling: Inconclusive
Rosie was to have her *right submandibular lymph node* sampled.
After waiting,
I got the call that the results were **inconclusive**.\
The assumption is that they mistakenly sampled another area.
However, their consensus remained the same-
A cancerous mass is present.

In this X-ray render,
you can see how far her right eye is pushed out by her cancer.
Her right eye is ~50% further out than her left.

## DICOM Imaging
For Rosie's CT scan,
I asked the *AHC* for the raw output of the procedure, and they delivered.\
The results are 1.47 GB of [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) imagery,
of which I have processed some renders,
seen above and throughout this update.

**It's really bad.**
I had seen the slices of imagery in the *AHC*,
but the full 3D renders
made in *(the unceremoniously titled)* [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/)
reveal developments I had not seen in detail before.

{{ resize_image(path="/pet/rosie/fundraiser/update-3/2024-12-14 - Front Bone-Blood.png", width=540, height=540, op="fill") }} \
You can see the cancerous mass on the right side of her skull is larger than her eye itself.\
It's sickening to me. Poor Rosie.

### DICOM Data Released Next Week
Next week,
Rosie's CT scan output in the DICOM format will be
released into the **Public Domain**.\
*The public paid for the scan,*
*the public gets the data--*
For any purpose whatsoever.

**Note:** This applies to the source DICOM data itself;
The renders I have made are released under the

## Supportive Care and Steroids
Due to her age, Rosie will not be getting chemotherapy,
nor will she be getting radiation therapy. Rosie's on steroids which I am grinding into her wet food.

Rosie's steroid *Prednisolone* cost $12 for a month's supply,
and since may be the last cost of her care,
Fundraising is no longer a pressing matter.\
The rest left is of pre-campaign costs,
such as her initial vet/AHC visits.

## Rosie has Weeks to a Month Left
Rosie's life expectancy is poor.\
The estimate is that Rosie lasting another month is at the higher end of her life expectancy.

## Rosie is Stumbly
Rosie's cognitive and motor abilities have been clearly affected.
She cannot move her head in a straight arc,
instead wobbling to her final angle.
More recently,
she is having difficulty navigating herself as well.
I will be trying to ease her navigation around the house.

### But Rosie is Energetic
Nonetheless, Rosie has actually been very chipper.
She's been more social, wanting to explore more,
and has been going wherever she wants.
She even explored outside-
something Rosie never wanted to do before-
And even met the neighbor's cat, James,
something we never thought would happen!

I hope she keeps that energy.
