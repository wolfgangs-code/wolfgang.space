# Rosie Rush!!!
## Update 1: On Track for Diagnosis
*It's Monday, November 25th, 2024.*
<hr>

At the time of writing,
we have raised **$785** through GoFundMe,
and an additional **$360** through other channels.\
The total so far: ***$1145***.
This is **phenomenal**-\
I was not expecting such a *huge* wave of support.
**Thank you all.**

But this amount is not yet enough to have a full CT + tissue sample
*($1400-$1700)*--\
It's not even at the minimum estimate given for *just* a CT scan
*($1200-$1500)*.

But I feel like we are *on-track* to have Rosie get a full package by next Monday.
I still have a lot of campaigning to do-
I have yet to even place physical posters up around town and on-campus.
We just have to work hard to keep the momentum that's been shown,
so Rosie can keep getting the best care possible throughout this emergency.

## CT Scan + Tissue Sampling Confirmed!

With this confidence in mind,
I called the
[*Animal Health Center*](https://www.vetmed.msstate.edu/clinics-locations/animal-health-center)
on-campus just before 11AM to confirm that the **full package**-
CT Scanning and tissue sampling, *the best possible diagnosis*,
Was what we were going for--
Only enabled by having raised the funds to do so.\
**This would have not been possible without your donations. Thank you.**

Unfortunately,
I was not available to get Rosie in *this week* like I had hoped- \
Her full diagnosis is scheduled for **Monday, December 2nd, 2024** at **7:30AM**.
I will be working hard this week to fulfill that promise.

## Vet Visit #3

*In the meantime,*
Rosie has a scheduled appointment with her regular veterinarian this Wednesday morning
for a [stain check](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003845.htm)-
Just to check on the state of her eye.\
Finally,
I have invested in an [inflatable cone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJW411HF) for Rosie,
so she can be more comfortable and free than her stock plastic cone.

*I will continue to keep everybody updated,*
*At least weekly or whenever any news arises.*

If you are able to and haven't done so,
please consider donating to Rosie. \
All public donors will be enshrined on [Rosie's webpage](/pet/rosie), too.

If you cannot donate, **sharing really does help**.
Rosie needs all the visibility she can get.
