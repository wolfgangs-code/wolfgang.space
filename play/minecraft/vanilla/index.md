# Vanilla+
The Vanilla-compatible modded Minecraft server.\
*To be more verbose,*
There are many mods installed on the *server*,
but none of them are incompatible with any vanilla *client*.\
However, a modded client will grant you some *(fair)* advantages.

This map has been running since *October 2024*.\
If I know you, and you want whitelist access,
*just ask me!*

## Client-enhancing Mods
***A [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)-based client is reccomended for mods!***\
While any vanilla client may play,
some client-side mods that
take advantage of modded server behavior are available here.

1. [Keep Inventories Sorted, Simple](https://modrinth.com/mod/kiss)
    - Allows you to sort your inventories and chests using a button,
        rather than needing to use the `/kiss` command to sort.
2. [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/mod/plasmo-voice)
    - Adds proximity voice chat to the game.
    * **Watch out!**
    *[Skulk Sensors](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sculk_Sensor)*
    *are activated by talking!*
3. [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons)
    - Adds a terrain LOD system to Minecraft. See far for cheap.
        * *Technically* has no server-side component, but
        I can't go back to playing without this cornerstone mod.
            **Try this mod!** You will be **amazed!**
4. [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)
    - Prevents chat reports from being sent to Microsoft's servers.
        * Snitches get stitches.
